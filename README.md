**Codelib** is new when compared to most PHP Frameworks. Many powerful features are undergoing development and testing. If 
you find any bug, feel free to report it or fix it.
If you provide a fix, or work on additional features, create a pull request.

If you choose to just report the bug, first make sure you can reproduce it, and provide enough information (error message, 
logs, request causing the issue, etc) so we can reproduce it too.
