### CREATE AND MAINTAIN ROBUST PHP APPS WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT WITH CODE-LIB, AN EASY TO LEARN PHP FRAMEWORK

**Quickly create easy to maintain web applications, with a variety of technologies: 
PHP 7.4+, MySql, VueJs, Bootstrap, or other.**

We use this simple framework for our own Apps, and we want it to be a **powerful** but **very simple to learn and use PHP Framework**.<br>
Using a combination of Framework features and Samples created for the Framework, we want anyone using it to be able to launch web applications within 
7 days, not in weeks or months.<br>
As a Framework, it is likely to be always work in progress, as it incorporates new technologies, features and security measures.<br>
Another goal of the framework is to make it easy to customize so that users can not only extend it with Plugins, but also 
easily replace core functionality, conventions and terminology.<br> 
Among its features:<br>
- Quickly create static and dynamic PHP Web Apps. 
- Create Plugins/Services for your app, and use Dependency Injection to wire all its dependencies.
- Replace different parts of the framework as you want without complications
- Easily create and reuse your own components
- Easily add filters to the request, response or specific functionality within your App.
- Easy collaboration among team members, with clear separation of concerns and conventions.
- Create complex workflows, with flow keys processed by one or many sync or async services.
- Easily make sense of how it works, even though its documentation is very limited at the moment.

#### Samples

Take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/codelibfw/cl-samples">samples</a> released under the Apache license. You can
use any of the samples as a starting point for your new Code-lib App.
You can also take a look at the <a href="http://codelibfw.com">Code-lib website</a> for additional information.

_Both, the number of samples and the Codelib website will continue growing as time passes._

#### Contributing

You are welcome to try the framework and samples provided, and use them to create your prototypes and products in an 
agile and painless way.

**Codelib** is new when compared to most PHP Frameworks. Many powerful features are undergoing development and testing. If 
you find any bug, feel free to report it or fix it.
If you provide a fix, or work on additional features, create a pull request.

If you choose to just report the bug, first make sure you can reproduce it, and provide enough information (error message, 
logs, request causing the issue, etc) so we can reproduce it too.
You can report a bug at: <a href="https://github.com/codelibfw/code-lib/issues">Code-lib issues</a>

_Working together we can create a better product that benefits us all_.

#### Sponsorship

The project already has a certain amount of funding to cover the cost of specific features under development. If you would 
like to support the development with any amount of funding, you are welcome to do so. Feel free to get in touch to discuss it.
More details will be made available here as soon as possible.

Code-lib is available under the permissive MIT License, which allows you to create any App using Code-lib, whether 
your project is open source or not, a personal project or for your business.
