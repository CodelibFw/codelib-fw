**Codelib** is a new project under active development. Many powerful features are undergoing development and testing. If 
you find any bug, feel free to report it or fix it.
If you provide a fix, or work on additional features, create a pull request to our **dev** branch.

If you choose to just report the bug, first make sure you can reproduce it, and provide enough information (error message, 
logs, request causing the issue, etc) so we can reproduce it too.
You can report a bug at: <a href="https://github.com/codelibfw/code-lib/issues">Code-lib issues</a>

_Working together we can create a better product that benefits us all_.

#### Sponsorship

The project already has a limited amount of funding to cover the cost of specific features under development. If you would 
like to support the development with any amount of funding, you are welcome to do so. Feel free to get in touch to discuss it.
More details will be made available here as soon as possible.
